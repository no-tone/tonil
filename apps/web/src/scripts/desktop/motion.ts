/* Motion — GSAP-powered micro-interactions layered over the CSS chrome.
   Kept deliberately small: the drawer slide itself stays CSS (cheap, and
   it already reads well); GSAP is used only where a hand-tuned stagger
   beats what CSS transitions can express — the content reveal as a panel
   mounts, and the ranked "best at" meters filling on entry.

   Everything here is a no-op under prefers-reduced-motion, and every
   tween clears the inline props it sets so the DOM is left exactly as
   the builders produced it (matters because panels are rebuilt on every
   open and language switch). */
