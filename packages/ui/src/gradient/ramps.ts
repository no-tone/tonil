/* Colour ramps for the gradient field.

   A ramp is a short list of `[position, colour]` stops that the field
   samples per pixel. Stops are authored in sRGB (matching tokens.css) but
   every ramp we *derive* is built in OKLCh - see ./oklab.ts for why.

   The named ramps are not a new palette. They are the site's existing
   signature colours, the ones the globe already assigns per node, spread
   into a field. Picking the ramp from the active signature is the point:
   the panel behind the content and the accent on the content are then the
   same colour system rather than two decisions kept in sync by hand. */

 *     through blue and magenta rather than sliding through grey. Interpolating
 *     the same pair in sRGB passes straight through the desaturated middle,

 *   - Lightness follows a fixed ladder rather than the anchors' own. Two
 *     colours picked for their hue rarely differ in lightness the way a field
 *     needs, and without this the gradient has no direction to travel in.
 *     The anchors contribute hue and chroma; the ladder supplies the climb.
